# Bus-Net
Hello and welcome to BUS-Set, a collection of several BUS datasets in the form of a benchmark.

DATASETS

The following links are the locations of the datasets used within the study:

OASBUD : https://zenodo.org/record/545928#.Y_TIs4DP20n

BUSI: https://scholar.cu.edu.eg/?q=afahmy/pages/dataset

UDIAT : http://www2.docm.mmu.ac.uk/STAFF/M.Yap/dataset.php

RODTOOK : http://www.onlinemedicalimages.com/index.php/en/81-site-info/73-introduction

Plus BUSIS : http://cvprip.cs.usu.edu/busbench/  but this was not used during the study


The OASBUD and BUSI are simple downloads, for RODTOOK you will have to navigator the website and download the images. 
Then for UDIAT a lisensing agreement will need to be signed. 

The only dataset that will need prep is RODTOOK, which will require all the surrounding annotations removed through cropping.
